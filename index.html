		<h1>The ElemenTest</h1>
		<h2>Can I weather the elements? <em>Let's find out.</em></h2>
		<p>
			Here is a paragraph element, a fundamental way to group text into a unit.
			The width it is allowed determines the number of lines that appear if no line break
			is forced.
		</p>
		<p>
			To initiate a second paragraph, the first &lt;p&gt; element is closed and
			a new one is created. This is the second one. To represent HTML tags within HTML, the Entity representation must be used. In this case an entity name was used (as opposed to an entity number).
		</p>

			Imagine your own private cabin in the woods, a quiet abode far away from noise of apartment life. A rarity in New York (at least the Southern tip) but a dream worth holding onto nonetheless.

			The only creaking to be heard are the invited cracks of a settling house as the fireplace exhales; not poorly constructed foundation giving way to the pounding onslaught from a stone-footed trash panda.
